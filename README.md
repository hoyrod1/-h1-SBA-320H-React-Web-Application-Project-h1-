<!--
Explanation of application
and instruction of what the application does
-->

This V1 application is a registration and login system that allows user to register to the web site.

Currently this application will store your credentials to local storage.

Once you are registered and your credentials saved to local storage you will be able to log in.

Once you are logged in you will be able to see a long list of amazing dogs which is being fetched using javascript.

Once you are done viewing the long list of dogs you have the capability of logging out.

While using "useReducer" I was not able to type inside the input fields.

So I will implement useReducer later.
